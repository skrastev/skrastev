# Hey, I'm Stanimir (Stam) 👋

I'm a cloud architect who designs systems on AWS and GCP—then actually builds them. Architecture comes first, DevOps practices are how I make it real.

## What I do

I help teams design cloud systems that make sense on paper and work in real life.
- I design AWS architectures and then actually build them — not just diagrams
- I automate infrastructure using the right tools for the job: Terraform, CloudFormation, Bash, Ansible, and more
- I design systems that are secure by default: least privilege, zero trust thinking, and proper secrets management
- I build CI/CD pipelines that support the architecture instead of constantly fighting it
- I build AI agents using Google’s ADK to automate cloud operations and decision-making
- I connect AI agents to real infrastructure using MCP servers and clients
- I design RAG systems that understand how your cloud is really set up, not just what the documentation says

The approach: start with solid architecture principles, then use DevOps practices to implement and maintain it. Not the other way around.

## Real projects, real decisions

I document actual cloud systems I've architected and built—the context, the tradeoffs, what worked and what I'd change.

## My toolbox

**Cloud architecture:** AWS (primary), GCP  
**AWS services:** EC2, Lambda, RDS, S3, CloudFront, Route53, Cognito, API Gatewaay, VPC, IAM, EventBridge, you name it  
**Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform  
**Automation & CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, Docker  
**Languages:** Python, Bash  
**Data layer:** PostgreSQL, Mysql, DynamoDB
**AI frameworks:** Google ADK (Agent Development Kit), MCP protocol, RAG pipelines, LLM integrations

## About me

Based in the EU, looking for cloud/solution architecture projects where I can design systems and see them through to production. I believe good architecture is useless if it never ships, and DevOps without architecture is just automated chaos.

What I care about: secure by design, cost-effective solutions, systems that don't fall apart when you look at them wrong.

If you want to discuss AWS architecture patterns, multi-region strategies, AI agents for cloud ops, or how MCP and ADK fit into real infrastructure—let's talk.
